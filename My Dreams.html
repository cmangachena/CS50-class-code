    I love order and I want to be among those that will be responsible for bringing the change to underdeveloped countries.
    I dream of bringing recycling and environmental awareness to Africa on a very high level. Proper disposal of waste and waste management, is my life-long dream to help all of Africa and beyond look as clean as Rwanda.." .
