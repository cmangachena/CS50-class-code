         I am a girl from Zimbabwe, born in the mid-density suburb of Kambuzuma. I have lived in several places in my country. I lived in Karoi, a town in the agricultural region of the country for most of my childhood. When I was 15 years old I moved to
         Budiriro, another mid-density suburb in Zimbabwe, and lived there for a year. My family finally moved to Mufakose and settled there, which is where I spent most of my teenage years. I live with my  mother and two little brothers, Anotida and Munotidaishe.
         I also have strong extended family ties so I have had my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins live with my family at some point growing up.
        I remember at one point there were eleven of us living in one house. I grew up in a relatively happy home and I like to think my childhood was normal. I have great people I love and respect, people who have been very influential in my life and helpful. I love my family the most.
