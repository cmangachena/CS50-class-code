# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
"Recycl&Earn app"-Chenai
I want to create some sort of app, either mobile or web, that helps make more people recycle and be kinder to the environment by using some sort of incentive
or rewards system. I want to make it so that people know how to recycle their stuff easily without having to think if
their trash is recyclable or not. They should be able to search within the app if their trash is recyclable and when they record that they have recycled, they can get points for it.
There will be implementation of some sort of validation check that ensures that they have recycled, and their points accumulate as they recycle. When they reach a certain number of points, they can redeem them for prizes.

"FO-MO-NO-MORE" - William
I hope to create a mobile application or a webpage that allows pre-assigned administrators to log in and post events happening on campus.
These will be placed into one of many predetermined categories, like study abroad opportunities, research opportunities, internship
opportunities, holiday voluntary work opportunities, recruitment events, academic and social events in Boston, and club activities
(including a category for miscellaneous activities).
This app/webpage will have search functionality, the ability to send alerts, and allow users to set reminders for specific events.
I might also allow people to share events with their friends.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Classmate = William Onyach
Section Leader = Jessica Eng


## Do you have any questions of your own?

What languages are we encouraged to use?
What methods of data validation are practical?
What kind of help are we allowed to use for the final project?
