  <h3>Hang on for just a bit though...</h3>
    <p>
      I would like you to know a few things about me...
      I am Class of 2022 student at Harvard College, <a id=a1 href="My Background.html"> from Zimbabwe</a> and my love for bead-making developed in my last few years of high school.
      A close acquintance of mine called Rebekah approached me and a group of friends a while ago during my preparation for college
      and she wanted us to help her fund-raise for her non-profit organization EducationMatters, and so she taught me how to make
      the beads. I learned it pretty quickly and easeily and I grew to like it.
    </p>

  <!--Final paragraph-->

    Proceed at your own risk! <a id=a1 href="Bead-making.html">BEAD-MAKING</a> is where all the fun is dished out!
