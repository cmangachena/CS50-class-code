FOMO NoMore Web App - William Onyach & Chenai Mangachena

This web app will be run entirely within CS50's IDE. All the necessary libraries have been imported into the code and all the pictures used in the design of the code
have been imported into the IDE.

Our final project, called “FOMO NoMore” is meant to be a website that allows Harvard students to view all the events that are happening on campus, all on a single
website. These events will be placed into different categories, based on their nature.

This web app will be run entirely within CS50's IDE. All the necessary libraries have been imported into the code and all the pictures used in the design of the code
have been imported into the IDE.

Administrators will be able to log in to post events. To do this, they should click on “Admin Register” then enter their username and password, then confirm the password.
All three of these are required fields. An error message will be rendered if any field is left blank or if the passwords don’t match. If they manage to register, they
should be redirected to the homepage, where they can now post new events

After registering, the admin will now be able to log in at any time and post events. They should click on Admin Login where they will be prompted to enter their username
and password. Both fields are required. If their username and password don’t match, or they aren’t stored together in the database, then an error message will be rendered.

To post events, the admin should click Post New Event. This will bring up a form, which will require that the admin choose which category from a drop-down list. Next, the
admin would have to enter the event name, event location, event date, event time, event cost, and a brief description of the event. If any field is left blank, the user will
be presented with an error message. Upon successful posting, the admin will be directed back to the home page where they will now be able to click on any category of event to
view the events that have been posted under these categories. They should also be able to view the event that they had posted, under the relevant category.

If a logged in administrator clicks on History, they will be able to view all the events that they have ever posted.

Available to all users, the events page can be accessed by clicking on All Events. This should bring up all the events ever posted in the website. Users also have the
ability to leave reviews by clicking on Leave A Review by filling in all the fields: event category, event name, event location, event date, and their review. All the fields
need to be populated with data otherwise an error message will be returned.

There exists a Share button on the All Events page and the individual event category pages which, upon clicking, the user will be presented with a template which will allow
them to send an email of the event to whomever they wish.

By clicking on View Reviews, users will be able to to view all the reviews ever left by any user of the website.

If a user clicks on the search button without entering any search terms, an error message will be returned. If a search term is entered, the user will be presented with all
the events that include their search term.

In the documentation folder is a file called "videolink.txt". This file includes the link to the video for our project.
