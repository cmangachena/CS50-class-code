# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

FO-MO-No-more

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An iOS app that allows users to be informed of the events happening on campus.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Create an iOS app that allows pre-assigned administrators to log in and post events happening on campus.
These will be placed into one of many predetermined categories, like study abroad opportunities, research opportunities, internship
opportunities, holiday voluntary work opportunities, recruitment events, academic and social events in Boston, and club activities
(including a category for miscellaneous activities). Categories will also have a review section where people can leave feedback on
past events they took part in.
This app will have search functionality, the ability to send alerts, and allow users to set reminders for specific events.
I might also allow people to share events with their friends.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will have an iOS app
It will allow pre-assigned administrators to log in and post events.
This app will have the ability to send alerts.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

This app will have search functionality.
This app will allow users to set reminders for specific events.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

This app will allow people to share events with their friends,
This app will also have a review section where people can leave feedback on
past events they took part in.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To learn Swifft language - both of us.
Learning how to use SQL with Swift - both of us.
Researching the data types that allow us to implement the following:
- ability to implemment log in - Chenai
- ability to extract information from user input for search functionality - William
- ability to set reminders and send alerts - William
- allow users to enter feedback - William
- ability to broadcast information - Chenai
Finding necessary information regarding the API's we may need to use within the app.- Chenai
- how to make the app interactive - Chenai
